Re:	Appeal of the Eta Chapter of Theta Xi Fraternity – Lehigh Case #__________

Dear Dean Mulvihill:

This letter shall serve as the appeal of the Eta Epsilon Chapter of Theta Xi Fraternity regarding 
the decision of the University as conveyed in your letter dated March __, ____, dissolving the 
Chapter for a period of two years from March __, ____ – March __, ____.

BASIS FOR APPEAL

The basis for the appeal, as more fully set forth below, is as follows:

_.	The sanction was unduly harsh;

_.	The University disciplinary procedures were violated in a way that probably adversely 
affected the outcome of the case.

SUMMARY OF CHARGES & SANCTION
On March __, ____, the University received a report from a residence life staff member regarding 
a text message mistakenly sent by a Theta Xi associate member to his residence hall GroupMe.  
This text message included information regarding the associate member process of the Theta Xi 
chapter at Lehigh.

In the meetings and hearings with Conduct officials of Lehigh, the three (_) members who were 
questioned offered information to clarify the meaning of the text message, as well as the purpose 
for this message.

After these _ interviews, the conduct officer charged the chapter with _ university violations 
related to Hazing, Interference, False Information, and Posted Rules and Regulations. The matter 
was sent to the University’s Committee on Discipline for review.  After the hearing with the 
Committee, the decision was reached that Theta Xi was found in violation for all _ of the 
aforementioned charges and sanctioned to immediate dissolution.  The rationale for this sanction 
was stated in the letter dated March __, ____ as:

	“Theta Xi is dissolved through May __, ____. This sanction is appropriate based on the fact 
that the
chapter has been on disciplinary probation since at least ____ and is currently on differed 
dissolution. In short, the chapter has a significant conduct history. Additionally, the panel 
did not find the information provided by the chapter at the hearing as credible and we do 
not believe the chapter has the ability to improve in the future under current leadership.”

RESPONSE TO SANCTIONS AND APPEAL - The sanction was unduly harsh
First, the Committee’s rationale for the sanction states that our “chapter has been on disciplinary 
probation since at least ____” is incorrect.  I am including the timeline of the Eta Chapter’s 
disciplinary history since ____ below, based on the letters received from Lehigh by our chapter, 
national fraternity, and advisors over the course of the past two years. 

____
_/__ – __/__ Probation
____
__/__ – _/_ Probation
____
_/_ – _/__ Differed Dissolution
_/__ – Dissolved

As you can see, our chapter was not on a disciplinary sanction of any kind from the university for 
a period of over __ months, spanning January _, ____ to November __, ____.  That said, the 
chapter does acknowledge that were on probationary status in the fall ____ semester due to a 
social event violation.  We also acknowledge that we were found responsible, along with nearly 
all other fraternities, of an additional recruitment related violation this past fall.  These two 
violations combined placed us on deferred dissolution status with the university.
 
Therefore, the rationale for the sanction to be “based on the fact that the chapter has been on 
disciplinary probation since at least ____” is an inaccurate and unfair statement, thus, making this 
sanction unduly harsh.

Additionally, other fraternities at Lehigh have been on deferred dissolution status and less finite 
sanctions have been applied.  For example, in the same university investigation into reports of 
fraternities using alcohol in recruitment activities, Phi Kappa Theta was also found to be 
responsible for the charges. At the time of the investigation and subsequent charges, Phi Kappa 
Theta had been on differed dissolution status with Lehigh University. When the investigation was 
concluded Phi Kappa Theta was found responsible for six (_) different infractions, however, 
instead of dissolution the chapter had its differed dissolution status extended and subsequent 
probation added. (http://lehighgreeks.blogspot.com/____/__/conduct-update-phi-kappa-
theta.html). The inconsistent application of dissolution as a sanction is concerning, and further 
causes our chapter to feel that the current sanction is unduly harsh.

Second, the rationale for this sanction was based on the perceived lack of credibility of the 
information provided by the chapter.  I believe that this statement was made in regard to our 
chapter’s explanation of the change of initiation date and our explanation of “pledge duties.”  Our 
chapter submitted our new member education plan to the university and our national 
headquarters for approval on December _, ____. Then chapter president Josh Bailey met with 
then Assistant Director, Office of Fraternity & Sorority Affairs Erin Wilensky Anderson to review 
the plan and make adjustments based on Erin’s questions and feedback. We received approval 
from Lehigh University on February _, ____.  We also received approval from our national 
headquarters on January _, ____.  As we began our associate member process this semester, we 
realized that the date we had planned for initiation would fall over Spring Break, a university 
holiday.  In order to ensure attendance at initiation for associate members and active brothers, 
we had to reschedule the initiation ceremony.  In Theta Xi, our initiation ceremony is performed 
for each new brother one person at a time.  Therefore, changing this requires a lot of work on the 
part of the actives.  It was not an easy decision to make, but one that would provide the best 
possible introduction to our fraternity.  In order to be transparent about this, we communicated 
the date change to the associate members on March _, ____ so that they would have one week 
to adjust their schedules.  There was no malice involved or disregard for the associate members’ 
other commitments.  The chapter did not want to create undue anxiety or stress with this change.  
Rather, we wanted to ensure that the ceremony was held at a time and date when everyone 
could attend.    

In regard to “pledge duties,” the chapter summarized these in an outline for the Committee’s 
review.  That outline is also included below:























While not mentioned in the New Member Education Plan, the concept of Pledge Duties was 
intended to be of less significance than items on the plan. The reason for its existence has no 
malicious intent, rather we thought of it as a method to ease our New Members into events on 
the NME plan and ensure that they are prepared to participate actively.

Third, the rationale for this sanction was based on the committee’s statement, “we do not believe 
the chapter has the ability to improve in the future under current leadership.”  Our chapter has 
made many strides in improvement over the past several years.  When a violation of university 
policy has been discovered, we have worked to correct this mistake, and implement methods to 
prevent these same mistakes from occurring again.  After the challenges of ____, new chapter 
leadership drafted a risk management policy and procedure for chapter events. The policy was 
distributed to chapter members and discussed during weekly chapter meetings. After the 
creation of this policy the chapter only had one violation in the __-month period between 
September ____ and November ____. 

Lastly, there is also no factual basis for the conclusion that the chapter has engaged in a negative 
"pattern of behavior" as suggested by the decision. In fact, the chapter had shown improvement 
on a number of fronts in the past two years. 

Theta Xi Fraternity Accreditation:
•	____-__: Accredited, seven of nine categories
•	____-__: Not Accredited, three of nine categories 

Lehigh University Accreditation:
•	____-__: Accredited
•	____-__: Not Accredited 

Chapter Accomplishments:
•	GPA increase of _.__ from Fall ____ – Present
•	House Chapter Room Renovation
•	Partnership with NAMI to focus on spreading awareness of mental health
•	Most brothers in recent Chapter history to be on executive boards of clubs

Contrary to a negative pattern of behavior, these examples seem to indicate a concentrated 
effort for improvement.  

RESPONSE TO SANCTIONS AND APPEAL - The University disciplinary procedures were violated in 
a way that probably adversely affected the outcome of the case.

In December ____, the chapters known contact in the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Affairs, 
Assistant Director Erin Wilensky Anderson left her employment at Lehigh University. At that time, 
the reassignment of chapters to other Lehigh University staff members was not communicated to 
the chapter or the national fraternity. 

On Friday, March __, ____, Associate Dean Christopher Mulvihill met with myself, chapter 
president Ted Lawlor. This was the first meeting I had with Dean Mulvihill as he would be the 
chapter’s appointed university advisor. It seems to be a conflict of student well being to have the 
same individual who oversaw the conduct hearing, and the panel overseeing this appeal, advising 
the chapter on matters of university process and procedure. 

CHAPTER PLAN MOVING FORWARD

Throughout the process of this hearing, the executive board members of the Theta Xi Fraternity 
have identified some practices of ours that we believe might need some adjustment to better 
align with the university’s goals for Greek Life on campus. This includes working on our New 
Member Education Plan to be more updated and inclusive of all expectations we share with our 
new members. Additionally, we have been working alongside our national fraternity to produce a 
recruitment plan to solidify our approach to recruitment moving forward. While improvements to 
previously expected plans are beneficial, we also will commit to working with the university to 
exceed the standards that they set forth. We aim to make many organizational improvements to 
the Eta Chapter of Theta Xi to be operating at its best potential.

Attached at the end of this document is a collection of materials that alumni and nationals have 
put together regarding their positions on this matter.

On behalf of the Eta Chapter of Theta Xi Fraternity, I hope that the Disciplinary Appeals 
Committee on will review our submission with careful consideration.  As a chapter, we want to be 
a positive member of the Lehigh community.  Dissolving our chapter will not allow our members 
to continue to make improvements and be a contributor to the progress of the Greek community.


Respectfully submitted,


Ted Lawlor, President
Eta Chapter of Theta Xi Fraternity
